# [Project 1: Maven Toyes Profit Margin](https://github.com/albert-tadros/Maven-Toyes-Profit-Margin-Project)

***This python data analysis project aims to improve the profit margin of the company Maven Toys using the company's products, sales, stores, and inventory data. The analysis was implemented using Python and its data analysis libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.***

**Question:** The executive at Maven Toys is interested in how they can strategically improve their margins. 

**Reframing the Question:** Analyzing the data, which products should Maven Toys focus on while utilizing what methods to improve overall sales margin. Which products are of interest company wide and which products are of interest at individual stores.

**Executive Summary:** This project provides an analysis and strategic recommendations for improving sales margins at Maven Toys by analyzing company wide and individual store data to identify specific products that can improve sales margin and by association sales revenue. The project will also identify products that hinder sales margin through analysis of low sales revenue and products with long shelf lifes. The method of our analysis consists of calculating average cost, generated sale revenue, product margin, variable correlation and age of inventory.

**The approaches to asnwer the project's question:**
1. Reduce the cost of goods for top selling products through strategic ordering and bulk purchasing.
2. Implement strategic offerings on products during periods of low revenue generation.
3. Encouraging sales of high margin products through product prominence in low performing locations.
4. Evaluating inventory data to identify margin reducing products.
5. Methods that should not be implemented because they reduce margin; against intuition

# [Project 2: The impact of COVID19 on the NYC Public High School Enrollment](https://github.com/albert-tadros/NYC-High-School-Studnet-enrollment)
***This python data analysis project aims to investigate any change in the enrollment number of high school students in NYC public school during COVID19 pandemic. The analysis was implemented using Python and its data analysis libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.***

**Problem Statement**

Overall, college enrollments in the U.S. declined by 4% during the year 2020 due to the pandemic. Given that high school education is just as important as college education, the goal of this analysis is to gain insights on effect of the pandemic on the NYC public high school enrollment numbers during the first year of the pandemic (2020 and early 2021).

**Guiding Research Questions**

Has public high school enrollment fallen like college enrollment?
Do public high school enrollments vary by student ethnicity and gender in 2020?
Do public high school enrollments vary between student of different economic advantage in 2020?
What has been the trend of public high school enrollment before the pandemic?
If an enrollment trend is recognized, can there be an explanation to change in the enrollment ?

**Project Objective and Methodology**

- The high school student enrollment in NYC public schools was analyzed using secondary data sourced from the NYSED data website.
- Descriptive analysis was used to uncover the trends of high school enrollment in New York City from 2017 to early 2021.
- The analysis was implemented using python and Jupyter notebooks:
- The following libraries were mainly used:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matlplotlib
    - Seaborn
